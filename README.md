# twitter-bot

This is simple php script which allows you to search tweets containing given keywords like "RT", "follow & retweet" so that you can get a kind of prize ðŸ’µ

In my repository, I use the very useful php library [abraham/twitteroauth](https://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth) developed by [him](https://github.com/abraham).

## Prerequisites

This script works on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).
So, if you don't have Heroku Account yet, please signup [here](https://signup.heroku.com/login)

Also It is necessary to install Heroku CLI into your terminal.
if you haven't installed it yet, please run this command below.

```
$ brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku
```

In addition to above, you need to obtain user access token for using Twitter API.
please obtain them before getting started.
if you are not familier with twitter api, Check it out [Here](https://www.slickremix.com/docs/how-to-get-api-keys-and-tokens-for-twitter/)



## Installation & Getting started


1. First, you need to clone this repository to anywhere you want.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/posaune0423/twitter-bot.git

$ cd twitter-bot

$ vi config.php
```

then you should see like this
```
<?php

define('CONSUMER_KEY', 'your consumerkey');
define('CONSUMER_SECRET', 'your consumer secret key');
define('ACCESS_TOKEN', 'your access token');
define('ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET', 'your secret access token');
```
please replace `your ~` statement to your actual API access token respectively.


2. Then, login to heroku, and create heroku app.
```
$ heroku login

$ heroku create [your app name or blank]
```

3. Add your git local repository to heroku remote repositry.
```
$ git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/{yourapp name}.git

$ git remote -v
```

4. then push this repository to your heroku app created right now
```
$ git push heroku master
```

5. Test the script by running it in a one-off worker dyno just to see it work before scheduling it

```
$ heroku run php src/test.php
$ heroku run php src/test.php                                                                              [master]
Running php src/test.php on â¬¢ shielded-cove-80623... up, run.2427 (Free)
It Works !
```

6. Add the [Scheduler Add-on](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler)

```
$ heroku addons:add scheduler:standard
```

7. Open the scheduler configuration page
```
$ heroku addons:open scheduler
```

8. Add the script as a job. Same as one-off step above, but without the `heroku run` - Add job... - `$ php src/test.php`

9. View the scheduled job running in the logs

```
$ heroku logs
